## v6.1.0-beta.0 Release Notes

### Features

#### (Breaking Change) Support for complex keys in Map and BigMap

This release introduces a breaking change to Map and BigMaps. In the forthcoming protocol "Carthage/006_PsCARTHA", it is possible to use a complex type composed of a pair as a key in a Smart Contracts Map or BigMap. This type of key isn't useable in Javascripts Map objects. 

This release introduces `MichelsonMap()` class that provides an abstraction over these details.

Existing code that accesses Map or BigMap storage via the Taquito data abstraction in the following fashion: 

```typescript
const account = storage.accounts["tz2Ch1abG7FNiibmV26Uzgdsnfni9XGrk5wD"]
```

Must be updated to use the `get()` and `set()` methods as follows;

```typescript
const account = storage.accounts.get("tz2Ch1abG7FNiibmV26Uzgdsnfni9XGrk5wD")
```
Additionally, if existing code initializes storage (during contract origination for example), this code must be updated. One can create a new `MichelsonMap()` as follows:

```typescript
    const map = new MichelsonMap()
    
    map.set({firstName:"Joe", lastName: "Bloe"}, "myValue")
    
    Tezos.contract.originate({
        code: myContractWithAPairAsKeyCode,
        storage: map
    })
```

Or one can also use the `fromLiteral` convenience method, as illustrated below.

```typescript
    Tezos.contract.originate({
        code: assertContractCode,
        storage: {
            owner: "tz2Ch1abG7FNiibmV26Uzgdsnfni9XGrk5wD",
            accounts: MichelsonMap.fromLiteral({
                "tz2Ch1abG7FNiibmV26Uzgdsnfni9XGrk5wD": {
                    balance: "1",
                    allowances: MichelsonMap.fromLiteral({
                      "tz3YjfexGakCDeCseXFUpcXPSAN9xHxE9TH2": "1"
                    })
                }   
            })
        }
    })
```

A pair can by uses as a key as follows:

```typescript
map.set({firstName:"Joe", lastName: "Bloe"}, "myValue")
storage.get({firstName:"Joe", lastName: "Bloe"})
```

## 6.0.3-beta.0 Local Forging, Batch Ops and more

This release brings several new features to Taquito. In line with our versioning policy, we have also bumped the major release number to v6 on this release, as this version has and continues to be tested against the Carthage testnet. By using this version of Taquito, your application will be compatible with both the Babylonnet protocol and the anticipated Carthage protocol. 

As per our versioning policy, we have now removed support for injecting Athens operations, as that protocol is no longer in use on mainnet or in an active testnet.

### Features

#### Local Forging

Taquito now supports Local forging of operations. This allows you to forge operations without relying on a Tezos node RPC. This feature is useful if you do not want to rely (trust) a public node, or if you want to forge & sign operations in an environment that is not accessible to the internet for security purposes.

See the `@dune-network/local-forging` package for the implementation.

Our integration tests for local forging work by forging many test cases using the local forger and the RPC forger endpoint. We then assert that the results from both implementations are identical.

#### Composite Forger

A new CompositeForger API is available, that allows you to forge an operation using more than one forging method, such as nodes forge RPC and Local forger. This approach provides additional surety that your operation is correctly composed. The CompositeForger will use more than one forger to produce the operation bytes and check that the bytes from each forger are identical. If the operations differ, the API will throw an error. [#238](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taquito/pull/238)

All Taquito integration tests that forge operations make use of the `CompositeForger` that relies on our local forger and the RPC based forger.

#### Batch Operation API

The Batch API allows you to group many operations into a single operation. Supported operations kinds are `transaction`, `origination`, `delegation` and `activate_account`.

Batch operations are useful for processing operations that would otherwise need to be injected once per block.

#### Taquito minified build published to [unpkg.co](http://unpkg.co)m CDN

Developers can now use Taquito using a `<script>` tag instead of using a package manager such as `yarn` or `npm`

All new releases of Taquito will be published to the [unpkg.com](http://unpkg.com) CDN. We will publish hash's of the CDN assets for every release, and we encourage users to make use of the [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) options to ensure that you are getting the correct version of Taquito.

```

#### Michelson encoder validation

Taquito now type checks data passed to the Michelson encoder prior to calling the RPC, providing better developer UX and faster error surfacing. See #211 for more details.

#### Subscribe to operations (experimental)

We have made a subscribe API that will poll the RPC behind the scenes. The API allows filtering on source/destination/hash and kind. This API may change in the future. Feedback is always welcome.

### Other changes

`BigMapAbstraction` is now exported from the taquito package #182

`michelson-encoder` has the ability to get Taquito's representation of type definitions from a smart contract. For example, storage and entrypoint type definitions.  

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- WS streamer package is flagged as un-maintained.

### Tests

We have added many new  unit and integration tests including but not limited to multisig contract interaction scenarios, emptying of accounts, and multiple big map encoding scenarios

### Fixes

fix(michelson-encoder): Fix improper encoding of boolean parameters #215

fix(michelson-encoder) Encoder now sorts maps and big map keys as expected by the protocol 

fix(estimator) Fix fee estimation of low balance accounts.

### Documentation Updates

Many code snippets on the documentation site are now editable and executable directly from the browser.

docs(website) Add setDelegate documentation page #193
docs(website) Add origination documentation page #196

### Acknowledgements and Thanks

We wish to thank the Zengo, Kukai, TQ Group, Truffle Michael Klein, Matej Å ima and anyone we have have missed. The input and feedback we get on Taquito is incredible valuable to us and we appreciate you all.

## 5.2.0-beta.1 Remote signer package, limits, bigmap abstraction and fixes

### Features

- Introduction of the remote signer package, allowing Taquito to interact with the Tezos HTTP  remote signer API
- `gasLimit`, `storageLimit` and `fees` are now surfaced on `Orgination`, `Transaction` and `Delegation` operations
- Our HTTP backend package now throws more useful errors, which extend javascript's `Error`
- New bigmap abstraction (released in 5.1.0-beta.1 but not announced)
- Michelson encoder now supports injectable custom semantics (currently only for bigmap)
- RPC: Support for the `/helpers/scripts/pack_data` endpoint
- Utils: Now expose a function for expression encoding `encodeExpr`

### Fixes

- Fixed issue with single value map storage not being decoded properly
- Fixed issue with encoding of collections as parameters and initial storage
- Fixed issue with our smart contract abstraction not picking up methods without annotations

## 5.0.1-beta.2 Support for Babylon protocol update

This release supports Babylon/Proto005. With this release, it is possible to inject operations into a chain running either `Athens/004` or `Babylon/005`.

Developers have two options around operating with the blockchain during the protocol amendment. First option, you can specify the protocol you expect to use in your provider as follows:

```js
Tezos.setProvider({protocol: Protocols.PsBabyM1})
```

Second option is to not specify the protocol in your provider. Taquito will discover the current protocol before injection an operation by querying the RPC. This method requires less code, but adds an additional RPC query for every injection and is thus slightly slower.

### Misc

- Polling interval for operation confirmation can be set globally for a taquito instance. Useful when working with `zeronet`

```js
Tezos.setProvider(
    {
        config: {
            confirmationPollingIntervalSecond: 10,
            confirmationPollingTimeoutSecond: 180
        }
    }
)
```

### Caveats

#### BigMap

Support for the new Babylon multiple BigMap feature is not yet supported.

### Fixes

- Estimation now properly supports estimation of internal operations

- In order to be consistent with Tezos RPC. All RPC types are now all *snake_case*.
